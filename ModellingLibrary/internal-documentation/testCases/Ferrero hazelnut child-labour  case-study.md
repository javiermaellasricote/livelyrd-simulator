# Ferrero hazelnut child-labour  case-study
#livelyRD/TestCases


## Data
### Player’s goals:
* For Ferrero: avoid using child labor at lowest possible cost. 
* For farmers: get cheap labor, and sell hazelnuts at highest possible profit. 
* For workers: get paid as much as possible (per family). 
* For government: ???
* For International organizations: ???

### Main goal: 
By Ferrero: Get children of Syrian migrant workers into school (and, therefore out of the plantation fields). 

### Current approach:
* Traceability of the product (Ferrero)
* Creation of education and daycare facilities for children (UTZ)

### Important data:
* Workers are moving from plantation to plantation.
> 	Many of the workers, especially those coming from the southeastern part of the country, are poor families forced to move north in search of extra income. They travel from farm to farm, working their way slowly up the hills. If necessary, they will stay at a farm for about 10 to 12 days to finish the job.

* Hazelnut harvesting is a seasonal activity.
* Most plantations are located around the city of Ordu. 
* Ferrero has achieved a tight control of its supply chain through the acquisition on the main hazelnut exporters.
* Only 40,000 farmers out of 400,000 have joined the Ferrero Family Values Program.
* Ferrero buys a third of the Turkish hazelnut production.

## Analysis on perspectives:
### Ferrero’s perspective:
Child labor practices in the hazelnuts plantation represents a risk for Ferrero. The sweets and chocolate companies are heavily reliant in their marketing and brand image to differentiate their products from the competition.

Therefore, a well coordinated anti-branding campaign targeting the fact that Ferrero indirectly employs child-labor in its supply chain could be extremely damaging for the company. 

Thus, it is in the best interest of Ferrero to avoid all cooperation with suppliers employing children for the harvesting of hazelnuts. 

On the other hand, Ferrero also needs to guarantee a constant, reliable and affordable supply of hazelnuts since it is on the main ingredients in many of its products. 

### Middle-man (manavs):
They buy the product from the farmers and sells it to big international exporters such us Ferrero. 
The international companies do not ask the middlemen for the working conditions in the farm and, therefore, the middlemen do not ask the farmers for the working conditions either. 

### Farm owner’s perspective:
The farm owners are mostly old and do not have big economic incomes. They usually contribute to the harvesting of the hazelnuts, but they are unable to do all the work by themselves. That is why they hire migrant workers who are willing to harvest the hazelnuts for wages below the minimum established by law.

Traditionally, the harvesting work was done by family members of the farmers. Now, those family members live in the  cities and do not participate in the process. This increases cost for farmers since they have to hire and pay workers to do the harvesting. 

Due to the high slopes of the terrain, and the traditional culture of the old farmers, mechanization of the hazelnut harvesting has not been achieved. 

### Worker’s perspective:
Most workers are Kurds and are discriminated against by the locals of the region. 

The workers are mostly poor families coming from regions closer to the Syrian border. They are brought to the hazelnut farms by “contractors” who get a 10% fee of their daily wages by giving them the opportunity to work. 

Since the wages are so small, the workers bring their entire family to pick up hazelnuts, making the children work in the fields. They sometimes demand farmers to let their children work in order to get an extra wage. 

If farmers refuse to let children work in their farms, they workers will threaten with leaving and going to work for another farm. 

### Government perspective:
The Turkish government does not seem to be collaborating in the effort to reduce child labour.

## Possible strategies:
The main problem arises from the need of the workers families to earn as much money as possible, and from the lack of control on the working conditions in the fields. 

### Do-nothing strategy:
Keep buying hazelnuts from middlemen with no knowledge on the working conditions on the field. This will certainly not solve the problem, but this could be used as the control to check how other strategies compare to this one. 

### Non-cooperation with farmers employing child-labour:
* This will include a 100% of the resources being bought to farmers in the Family Values Program

### Competition against farmers employing child-labour:

### The UTZ approach (Code of conduct members):

### Farmer cooperative model:

### Compete against current structure through vertical integration:
Probably quite costly.
